# Development Workflow

## Package Management
- **Use npm only** - This project does not use yarn
- No `yarn.lock` file is included in the repository
- All scripts in [package.json](mdc:package.json) use npm commands

## Build System
- **esbuild** for fast builds and bundling
- Configuration in [esbuild.config.mjs](mdc:esbuild.config.mjs)
- TypeScript compilation with strict rules
- Hot reload during development

## Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development with watch mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Biome linting and formatting
npm run lint          # Lint only
npm run format        # Format check only
npm run check         # Lint + format + organize imports
npm run check:fix     # Fix all issues automatically
```

## Development Phases
Currently in **Phase 1: Setup and Foundation**
- ✅ Project structure and configuration
- ✅ TypeScript setup with strict rules
- ✅ Build system with esbuild
- ✅ Testing framework with Jest
- ✅ Basic plugin structure
- ✅ Biome setup for linting and formatting

Next: **Phase 2: Data Layer**
- Implement storage engine
- Create data models
- Setup compression system
- Build migration framework

## Code Quality
- Biome for code linting, formatting, and import organization
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Jest for testing with >80% coverage goal
- Pre-commit hooks for automated code quality checks

## Git Workflow
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Run tests and Biome checks before committing
- Follow conventional commit format when possible

## Documentation
- Update [README.md](mdc:README.md) for user-facing changes
- Update [DEVELOPMENT.md](mdc:DEVELOPMENT.md) for developer changes
- Document new features and APIs
- Keep [STATUS.md](mdc:STATUS.md) updated with progress
