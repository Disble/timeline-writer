## Phase-Specific Guidelines

### Phase 2: Data Layer Requirements
When working on Phase 2, focus on:
- Read [specs/phases/fase-2-data-layer.md](mdc:specs/phases/fase-2-data-layer.md)
- Implement storage engine following [specs/architecture/storage-engine.md](mdc:specs/architecture/storage-engine.md)
- Use data models from [src/data/models/core.ts](mdc:src/data/models/core.ts)
- Follow storage patterns in [src/data/storage/IStorageEngine.ts](mdc:src/data/storage/IStorageEngine.ts)

**Current Status**: 85% complete - Only validation system and backup/recovery remain

### Phase 3: Context Detection (COMPLETED)
- Read [specs/phases/fase-3-context-detection.md](mdc:specs/phases/fase-3-context-detection.md)
- Follow [specs/architecture/context-detection.md](mdc:specs/architecture/context-detection.md)
- Implement in [src/core/context-detection/](mdc:src/core/context-detection/)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - All analyzers and detection engine implemented

### Phase 4: Version Management (COMPLETED)
- Read [specs/phases/fase-4-version-management.md](mdc:specs/phases/fase-4-version-management.md)
- Follow [specs/architecture/timeline-engine.md](mdc:specs/architecture/timeline-engine.md)
- Implement in [src/core/version-manager/](mdc:src/core/version-manager/)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Navigation, branching, and version management implemented

### Phase 5: User Interface (CURRENT)
- Read [specs/phases/fase-5-user-interface.md](mdc:specs/phases/fase-5-user-interface.md)
- Follow component specs in [specs/components/](mdc:specs/components/)
- Implement in [src/ui/](mdc:src/ui/)

**Status**: üîÑ In Progress - Timeline visualization and comparison view needed

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization
- Read [specs/phases/fase-6-testing.md](mdc:specs/phases/fase-6-testing.md)
- Focus on test coverage and performance optimization

- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Phase Transition Checklist

Before moving to next phase:
- [ ] Current phase objectives completed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Next phase specs reviewed

## Current Development Focus

**Primary Focus**: Phase 5 - User Interface
- Timeline visualization with vis-timeline
- Version comparison interface
- Settings panel integration
- Obsidian workspace integration

**Secondary Focus**: Complete Phase 2 remaining items
- Validation system with Zod
- Backup and recovery system
- Performance optimization

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Project Progress**: 67% complete
- Phase 1: ‚úÖ 100%
- Phase 2: ‚úÖ 85%
- Phase 3: ‚úÖ 100%
- Phase 4: ‚úÖ 100%
- Phase 5: üîÑ 30%
- Phase 6: ‚ùå 0%

## Quality Gates

Before committing any code:
- [ ] Relevant specifications have been read and understood
- [ ] Implementation aligns with current phase objectives
- [ ] Architecture patterns are followed
- [ ] Component specifications are respected
- [ ] No deviations from specified design without documentation

- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Next phase specs reviewed
