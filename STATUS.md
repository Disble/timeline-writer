## Development Workflow

### ✅ Established Workflow
```
Development → Build → Install → Test
     ↓           ↓        ↓       ↓
   src/ → npm run build → dist/ → install-plugin.ps1 → Obsidian
```

### 🛠️ Available Commands
- **`npm run dev`** - Development mode with hot reload
- **`npm run build`** - Production build to dist/
- **`npm run copy-manifest`** - Copy manifest to dist/
- **`.\install-plugin.ps1 -VaultPath "path"`** - Install to Obsidian vault
- **`npm test`** - Run test suite
- **`npm run lint`** - Code linting
